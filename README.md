### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Data Analytics student at the University of St. Thomas, specializing in Informational Systems with a minor in Spanish. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a Service Desk and Desktop Support Intern, contributing to the smooth rollout of Windows and Apple devices in close collaboration with our full-time ITS staff. 

Aside from my internship, I also hold positions as a Service Desk Technical Support Specialist and a Computer Science Grader. In these roles, I offer professional assistance with hardware and software issues, as well as evaluate Java coding labs while providing valuable feedback to enhance coding skills.

My proficiency extends to the Microsoft Office Suite and Java, and I hold certifications in Cybersecurity and Network Security, reflecting my commitment to staying updated with industry trends.

On a personal note, I have achieved Intermediate High Spanish proficiency, earning a Minnesota Gold Bilingual Seal.

I am eager to connect and explore our mutual passion for technology! Let's connect and share our insights in the ever-evolving world of IT.
