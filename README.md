### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Data Analytics student at the University of St. Thomas, specializing in Informational Systems with a minor in Spanish. My passion for tech started way back in middle school with the Tech Titans program. That early start has led me to some exciting places, like recently completing my first internship in Service Desk and Desktop Support, contributing to the deployment of new tech on campus.

Beyond my internship, I'm actively involved as a Service Desk Technical Support Specialist and a Computer Science Grader, where I get to indulge in my love for problem-solving and coding in Java.

My commitment to tech is backed by certifications and a continuous quest to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. With a knack for Microsoft Office Suite and a proud holder of the Minnesota Gold Bilingual Seal for my Spanish skills, I'm all set to take on the next challenge.

I am eager to connect and explore our mutual passion for technology! Let's connect and share our insights in the ever-evolving world of technology.
