### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Data Analytics student at the University of St. Thomas, specializing in Informational Systems with a minor in Spanish. Currently, I proudly serve as the President of the Computer Science Club, fostering a community of tech enthusiasts and facilitating engaging activities.

In addition to my role as the club president, I am honored to be recognized as a Science, Mathematics & Engineering Scholar at the University of St. Thomas. As a Science Scholar, I represent and promote the science, mathematics, and engineering programs through various functions, showcasing leadership and a contagious excitement for these fields. This highly selective program, which considers factors such as high school performance, recommendation letters, STEM tests, an essay, and an interview, granted me a scholarship and the opportunity to join a community of well-rounded, high-achieving individuals passionate about science, mathematics, and engineering.

My journey into the tech world began in middle school with the Tech Titans program, and since then, I've recently completed my first internship in Service Desk and Desktop Support. This experience allowed me to contribute to the deployment of new technology on campus, further fueling my passion for the ever-evolving world of technology.

Beyond my internship, I am actively involved as a Service Desk Technical Support Specialist and a Computer Science Grader, where I get to indulge in my love for problem-solving and coding in Java.

My commitment to technology is reflected in my pursuit of certifications and my continuous efforts to stay ahead in this dynamic field. I am well-prepared to take on the next challenge. Furthermore, I hold the Minnesota Gold Bilingual Seal, certifying my proficiency in Spanish.

I am eager to connect and explore our mutual passion for technology! Let's connect and share our insights in the ever-evolving world of technology!
